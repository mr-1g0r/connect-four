# Stage 2/4: Placing the pieces
## Description
An empty game board isn't of much use if we can't do anything with it. In this stage, we will add two important features. First, we need to allow players to place the game pieces. In the board game, they are of different colors. In this desktop version, we will use different letters â€” X and O.

Second, we need to alternate player turns so that each person can get a fair chance. At this stage, place a piece in the cell where players click and then alternate turns after every click, starting with X.

## Objectives
In this stage, your program should:

Display an empty game board, where each cell displays a single space " " as its label;
When a player clicks on a cell, change that cell's label to either X or O depending on the turn, starting with X.
